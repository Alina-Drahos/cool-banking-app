## Setting up the initial connection

### Environment Variable:

To connect to the Plaid API, you'll need to set up environment variables. Here's what you need to do:

Create a .env file: Start by creating a .env file in your backend directory.

Add Plaid API credentials: Inside the .env file, include the following values:

PLAID_CLIENT_ID: This is your Plaid API client ID.
PLAID_SECRET: Your Plaid API secret.
These credentials are generated by the Plaid API and can be obtained by logging into your Plaid account and navigating to your individual dashboard. It's crucial to remember not to commit these credentials to GitHub. Make sure they are included in your .gitignore file.

Configure additional variables: In addition to the client ID and secret, you'll need to set up three more environment variables for the initial request of a Link Token:

PLAID_ENV: The environment to use (e.g., sandbox, development, production).
PLAID_PRODUCTS: The products to access (e.g., transactions, auth, identity).
PLAID_COUNTRY_CODES: The country codes for the institutions you want to support.
Import and use the .env file: In your backend's src/routes/BankingRoutes.ts file, import the .env file and set up the initial connection via its GET endpoint.

By following these steps and configuring the necessary environment variables, your application will be able to connect to the Plaid API securely.
