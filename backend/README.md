## Setting up the initial connection
### Environment Variable:
In order to connect to the Plaid API, a .env was created in the backend.
Your .env file should contain two values that were generated by 
the PLAID API, a PLAID_CLIENT_ID and a PLAID_SECRET. 
One can retrieve these values upon logging  into the PLAID website and navigating to one's individual 
dashboard. It is important to let the .gitignore file know that these values CAN NOT be checked
into Github. Additionally, three more envioronment variables should be configured to initially
request a Link Token : PLAID_ENV, PLAID_PRODUCTS and PLAID_COUNTRY_CODES. The File 
backend\src\routes\BankingRoutes.ts imports the .env file and sets up the initial connection
via its get endpoint.
